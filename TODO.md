# Todo

- A way to support multiple and/or country-specific phone number lookup websites
- Better mobile breakpoint font support
- Add support for toggling modem into modes to support country-specific FSK/DTMF spec.
- Perhaps some way of forcibly hanging up calls that are detected as dangerous
- Attempting to dial out during a call, to detect a busy line and therefore keep the rating report on the screen for the call duration.
- Integrate another means of physical alerting that is more simple/brutal, like a flashing red light.
- Packaging as a Chrome Extension so it requires no persistence as a web page at all
- deno?
